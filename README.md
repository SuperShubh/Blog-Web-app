# Blog-Web-app

• Designed and developed a full-stack web application, allowing administrators over the creation, modification, and
deletion of blogs, and users are granted the privilege to interact with the content through actions such as liking,
unliking, and commenting.

• Leveraged React.js and Redux for efficient state management, Material-UI for responsive and visually appealing UI
components, and React Router for seamless navigation and routing within the application.

• Integrated the frontend with backend APIs developed using Node.js and Express.js. Utilized RESTful API
architecture to handle user authentication, data retrieval, and data manipulation.

• Implemented React Toastify library for displaying user-friendly notifications, utilized Bcrypt for secure password
hashing, and integrated drag and drop functionality with Cloudinary for seamless image upload and management
